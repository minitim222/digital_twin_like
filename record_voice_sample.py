This will record your voice for cloning with ElevenLabs or other services.

For best results:
1. Find a quiet place
2. Speak naturally in a conversational tone
3. Read the provided text clearly
4. Recording will be 90 seconds (you can stop early with Ctrl+C)

Sample text to read:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, I'm Tim Cao, a computational biology researcher at Harvard
University. My research focuses on spatial transcriptomics and neural
stem cell biology. I develop computational tools to analyze complex
biological data, using techniques like MERFISH, Xenium, and Visium HD.

I'm particularly interested in understanding how pregnancy affects brain
development and neural stem cell regulation. I work with Python, R, and
various machine learning frameworks to build reproducible pipelines for
multi-omics data analysis.

My technical skills include deep learning with PyTorch and TensorFlow,
single-cell analysis with Scanpy and Seurat, and cloud computing with
AWS and GCP. I've co-authored publications in Nature Neuroscience and
Nature Communications, focusing on computational approaches to
understanding biological systems.
