# Auto-Continue Feature Update

## Changes Made

The voice interaction system now **auto-continues** conversations without requiring you to press 'y' after each response.

---

## What Was Changed

### 1. **Removed Manual Continuation Prompt**

**Before** (`run_voice.py`):
```python
while True:
    voice_twin.voice_interaction(recording_duration=duration)
    continue_chat = input("\nContinue? (y/n): ").strip().lower()  # ❌ Manual prompt
    if continue_chat != 'y':
        break
```

**After**:
```python
while True:
    user_input, response = voice_twin.voice_interaction(recording_duration=duration)

    # Check if user said quit/exit
    if user_input and any(word in user_input.lower() for word in ['quit', 'exit', 'stop', 'goodbye']):
        print("\nGoodbye!")
        break

    # ✅ Auto-continue - no prompt needed!
```

### 2. **Disabled CrewAI Execution Traces**

**Added to `voice_agent.py`**:
```python
# Disable CrewAI execution trace prompts
os.environ["CREWAI_STORAGE_DIR"] = "/tmp/crewai"
os.environ["CREWAI_TELEMETRY_OPT_OUT"] = "true"
```

**Updated Crew configuration**:
```python
crew = Crew(
    agents=[self.conversation_agent],
    tasks=[response_task],
    process=Process.sequential,
    verbose=False,
    memory=False,   # ✅ Disable memory to avoid prompts
    cache=False     # ✅ Disable cache for faster execution
)
```

## How to Exit Voice Mode

### Option 1: Say "Quit" (Recommended)
Just speak one of these words:
- "quit"
- "exit"
- "stop"
- "goodbye"

The system will automatically detect and exit.

### Option 2: Press Ctrl+C
Force exit at any time with keyboard interrupt.

1. Speak your question
2. Hear the response
3. Immediately speak your next question
4. Say "quit" when done

No manual intervention needed! 🎉
